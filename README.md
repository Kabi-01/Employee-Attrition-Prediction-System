# Employee Attrition Prediction System

---

## 📌 Overview
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, leading to increased hiring costs and loss of experienced talent.  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning–based system** to predict employee attrition by analyzing historical employee data and identifying key factors that influence turnover.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze employee data to identify attrition patterns
- Build a predictive system for employee attrition
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Support data-driven decision making in HR analytics
